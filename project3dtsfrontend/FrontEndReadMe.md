# DangerZone

Welcome to DangerZone, a full-stack web application created by three budding developers that combines our love of animals with our desire to collaborate and learn React. DangerZone educates users about endangered species and allows logged-in users to add their favorite endangered animal to their own profile page. Members also have access to news articles specifically about endangered animals and how you can help keep our beloved animals alive.
