## Approach Taken

For our app:

We want to separate out our components as much as possible to make it easier to work in groups and isolate the problem

### App Structure

1. App
   1. App.js
2. Animals
   1. Animals.js : Holds info about animals and populates all animals
3. Creators
   1. Creators.js : Hold info about developers
4. Donate
   1. Link to donations
5. Header
   1. Has Nav bar
6. Home
   1. Contains About info
   2. Creators Info
7. Login
   1. Login
8. Logout
   1. Logout
9. News
   1. All the articles

## Responsible parties

1. David - Get start up completed, meaning starting routes and link tos
2. Tasha - User on FrontEnd, deploy Frontend
3. Stephanie - News and Animals on FrontEnd, Deploy backend
4. Group - Connect front and back
5.
